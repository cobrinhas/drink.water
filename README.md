# drink.water

Drinking water is important, we all know that. But nowadays we tend to forget that (probably due to the impact of short term rewards in social media)
we need to drink water regurarly. This script helps me fix that :)

## Installing

This script uses [Free Desktop Notification Client](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/notification-spec-latest.html) and should work out-of-the-box
in any distro that ships with X.11 or Wayland. It run as cron job that is schedule via crontab.

```bash
./INSTALL
```
