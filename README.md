# drink.water

Drinking water is important, we all know that. But nowadays we tend to forget that we need to drink water regurarly. This script helps me fix that :)

## Installing

This script uses [Free Desktop Notification Client](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/notification-spec-latest.html) and should work out-of-the-box in any distro that ships with X.11 or Wayland. It runs as cron job that is scheduled via crontab.

Also, if you have `paplay` command available (Pulse Audio), it shall play a notification sound.

```bash
./INSTALL
```
